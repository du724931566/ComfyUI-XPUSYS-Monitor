> **Diversity & Coexistence: A Sincere Effort from the "Minority"**
>
> In the ComfyUI ecosystem, Intel Arc (XPU) users may be in the "minority" — but that's exactly why we started. With a scarcity of native XPU monitoring plugins, we set out to build a stable, minimal tool that respects the underlying hardware specs for Intel GPU users.
>
> But we didn't stop there. Through a generalized architecture, this plugin now fully supports both NVIDIA (CUDA) and AMD (ROCm).
>
> No matter what GPU you're running, this plugin gives you a clear, at-a-glance view of your system's vitals. Born in the XPU community, open to all platforms — we hope you enjoy it.

## Overview

**ComfyUI-XPUSYS-Monitor** is an Intel Arc-first ComfyUI hardware monitor that displays real-time GPU, CPU, and RAM stats as capsules in the top menu bar. It features an exclusive **Workflow Execution Success Rate Predictor** that estimates whether your workflow will complete successfully — before you even click Run. NVIDIA (CUDA) and AMD (ROCm) are fully supported.

---

## Features

The status bar contains seven capsules from left to right, split into two groups:

```
[ PRED ]  [ CPU ]  [ RAM ]  |  GPU  |  VRAM  |  RSV  |  PWR  |
 Predict   Processor Memory     └──────── GPU Group ──────────┘
```

> Hover over any capsule to expand its detailed data panel.

## Workflow VRAM Predictor (PRED) Deep Dive

### What is it predicting?

Before you click Run, the plugin quietly estimates one thing:

> **"Given the current state of this machine, how likely is this workflow to complete without crashing?"**

That probability is what the `PRED` capsule shows. The most common reason AI image generation crashes is simple — **not enough VRAM**. But "not enough" isn't binary: the system can borrow from RAM and virtual memory to compensate, so success probability is a continuous value, not a yes/no.

### Core Insight: Models Don't Need to Be in VRAM Simultaneously

ComfyUI workflows run **serially** — CLIP encoding, diffusion sampling, VAE decoding each load, run, and unload one at a time.  
So the real rules for "can this run?" come down to just two constraints:

1. **Can the largest single model fit in VRAM?** (Hard constraint — determines survival)
2. **Can all models relay through RAM?** (Soft constraint — determines stability)

### How Each Constraint Affects Success Rate

**Hard Constraint — Peak Model vs Available VRAM**

```
Available VRAM = (Free VRAM + PyTorch Cache) × 0.9
```

The `0.9` discount accounts for VRAM fragmentation. The more overflow, the steeper the drop:

| Overflow | Intel Arc | NVIDIA (with UVM) |
|----------|-----------|-------------------|
| 0% (just fits) | 100% | 100% |
| 100% (2× VRAM) | ~5% | ~47% |
| 200% (3× VRAM) | ~0% | ~22% |
| 300% (4× VRAM) | ~0% | ~5% |

**Platform Differences:** NVIDIA's CUDA Unified Memory (UVM) allows models to page between VRAM and system RAM automatically. This means NVIDIA GPUs can successfully run workflows that exceed physical VRAM by up to ~4× (depending on PCIe bandwidth and system RAM speed), while Intel Arc has stricter limits.

**Soft Constraint — Total Model Size vs RAM / Virtual Memory**

| Scenario | Success Rate Range |
|----------|--------------------|
| All models fit in VRAM | 100% |
| Exceeds VRAM, but free RAM can relay | 70%–100% |
| RAM also insufficient, needs virtual memory (disk paging) | 5%–70% |
| Even virtual memory is exhausted | ~0% |

**Final Success Rate = Hard Constraint Rate × Soft Constraint Rate**

> Key takeaway: If the largest model can't fit in VRAM, overall success rate will be severely dragged down regardless of how much RAM you have.

### Color Signals and Recommended Actions

| PRED Display | Meaning | Recommendation |
|-------------|---------|----------------|
| 🟢 ≥ 80% | Safe | Run freely |
| 🟡 40%–80% | Warning | Close memory-heavy apps, or reduce model precision |
| 🔴 < 40% | Danger | Reduce model count in workflow, or switch to smaller models |

### Practical Tips to Reduce Memory Pressure

- Replace FP16 models with **quantized models** (GGUF Q4/Q8) — cuts VRAM usage by 50–75%
- Set unused nodes to **bypass** — the predictor automatically excludes them
- Close browsers, games, and other memory-heavy apps before running
- After an OOM crash, **restart ComfyUI** to clear VRAM fragmentation — the same workflow may succeed afterward
- If using multiple LoRAs, consider merging them into a single file in advance

> **Note**: The algorithm estimates VRAM usage from model disk file sizes. For quantized models (GGUF), actual VRAM usage is much lower than the estimate — so the true success rate will be higher than displayed. This is intentional conservative estimation; the bias direction is safe for users.

## Permissions (Intel Arc Users — Important)

Intel Arc (XPU) uses **Level Zero Sysman** as its backend. On Windows, Sysman requires administrator privileges to read power, temperature, and other hardware data.  
**All Intel Arc users are strongly recommended to launch ComfyUI as Administrator**, otherwise the following features will be unavailable:

| Feature | Normal | Admin |
|---------|--------|-------|
| GPU Load / Frequency | ✅ | ✅ |
| Temperature | ❌ | ✅ |
| Power (PWR) | ❌ | ✅ |
| VRAM Predictor (PRED) | ✅ | ✅ |
| CPU / RAM Monitoring | ✅ | ✅ |

> NVIDIA / AMD users are not affected — full data is available without elevated privileges.

### Two Ways to Run as Administrator

#### Option 1: Right-Click (Quick & Temporary)

1. Locate your ComfyUI launch script (e.g. `run_nvidia_gpu.bat` or `Stable_Start_IntelARC.bat`)
2. **Right-click** → select **"Run as administrator"**
3. Click **"Yes"** in the UAC prompt

> This requires manual action every time. Best for occasional use or testing.

#### Option 2: Embed Auto-Elevation in Your Launch Script (Recommended)

Add the following block to the **very top** of your `.bat` script. It detects non-admin context, closes the current window, and relaunches itself elevated automatically:

```bat
:check_admin
net session >nul 2>&1
if %errorLevel% == 0 (
    goto :admin_start
) else (
    echo [Permission Check] Requesting administrator privileges...
    powershell -Command "Start-Process '%~f0' -Verb RunAs"
    exit
)

:admin_start
cd /d "%~dp0"
echo [OK] Privileges elevated. Starting ComfyUI...
```

**Usage notes:**
- Paste this block after `@echo off` at the top of your `.bat` file
- Put your original launch logic after `:admin_start`
- The first run will show a UAC prompt — click "Yes". The elevated window then continues automatically.

**Full example structure:**

```bat
@echo off
chcp 65001 >nul

:check_admin
net session >nul 2>&1
if %errorLevel% == 0 (
    goto :admin_start
) else (
    echo [Permission Check] Requesting administrator privileges...
    powershell -Command "Start-Process '%~f0' -Verb RunAs"
    exit
)

:admin_start
cd /d "%~dp0"
echo [OK] Privileges elevated. Starting ComfyUI...

:: ↓ Add your original launch commands below ↓
:: e.g.: call conda activate comfyui
:: e.g.: python main.py --listen 0.0.0.0
```

- PyTorch 2.5+ (XPU build required for Intel Arc)
- Windows (primary test environment); Linux theoretically compatible — feedback welcome

---

## Known Limitations

### ComfyUI-AIMDO-XPU (PYTHONPATH Hijack) Environment

On Intel Arc systems running the [ComfyUI-AIMDO-XPU](https://github.com/allanmeng/ComfyUI-AIMDO-XPU) adapter (which hijacks CUDA → XPU via `PYTHONPATH`), the plugin's PyTorch-level memory tracking has the following behavior:

| Metric | Behavior |
|--------|----------|
| **VRAM capsule** (driver-level used/total) | ✅ Works correctly — reads from Level Zero Sysman (`zesMemoryGetState`) |
| **RSV capsule** (`memory_reserved`) | ✅ Changes during workflow execution; drops to 0 when workflow ends (see CHANGELOG v1.0.3 for PyTorch 2.12 behavior) |
| **VRAM detail → Models & Compute** (`memory_allocated`) | ❌ Stays at 0 — model memory allocations go through AIMDO's hijack layer, bypassing PyTorch's Python-level allocator tracking |

This is an **expected limitation** of the PYTHONPATH hijack approach. The adapter's runtime-patching layer intercepts CUDA API calls at a level that `torch.xpu.memory_allocated()` cannot observe. The hardware-level VRAM reading (Level Zero) is unaffected and remains fully accurate.

To verify: disabling AIMDO-XPU and running ComfyUI with native XPU support restores full `memory_allocated()` tracking.
